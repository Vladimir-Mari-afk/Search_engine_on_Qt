Green oak near Lukomorye.
There is a green oak near the Lukomorye;
Golden chain on the oak tree:
Day and night the cat is a scientist
Everything goes round and round in a chain;
He goes to the right - the song starts,
To the left - he tells a fairy tale.
There are miracles there: a goblin wanders there,
The mermaid sits on the branches;
There on unknown paths
Traces of unseen beasts;
There's a hut there on chicken legs
It stands without windows, without doors;
There the forest and valley are full of visions;
There the waves will rush in at dawn
The beach is sandy and empty,
And thirty beautiful knights
From time to time clear waters emerge,
And their sea uncle is with them;
The prince is there in passing
Captivates the formidable king;
There in the clouds in front of the people
Through the forests, across the seas
The sorcerer carries the hero;
In the dungeon there the princess is grieving,
And the brown wolf serves her faithfully;
There is a stupa with Baba Yaga
She walks and wanders by herself,
There, King Kashchei is wasting away over gold;
There is a Russian spirit there... it smells like Russia!
And there I was, and I drank honey;
I saw a green oak by the sea;
The scientist cat sat under him
He told me his fairy tales.

Tatiana's letter to Onegin.
I am writing to you - what more?
What more can I say?
Now I know it's in your will
Punish me with contempt.
But you, to my unfortunate fate
Keeping at least a drop of pity,
You won't leave me.
At first I wanted to remain silent;
Believe me: my shame
You would never know
If only I had hope
At least rarely, at least once a week
To see you in our village,
Just to hear your speeches,
Say your word, and then
Think about everything, think about one thing
And day and night until we meet again.
But, they say, you are unsociable;
In the wilderness, in the village, everything is boring for you,
And we... we don’t shine with anything,
Even though you are welcome in a simple-minded way.
Why did you visit us?
In the wilderness of a forgotten village
I would never have known you
I wouldn't know bitter torment.
Souls of inexperienced excitement
Having come to terms with time (who knows?),
I would find a friend after my heart,
If only I had a faithful wife
And a virtuous mother.
Another!.. No, no one in the world
I wouldn't give my heart!
It is destined in the highest council...
That is the will of heaven: I am yours;
My whole life was a pledge
The faithful's meeting with you;
I know you were sent to me by God,
Until the grave you are my keeper...
You appeared in my dreams,
Invisible, you were already dear to me,
Your wonderful gaze tormented me,
Your voice was heard in my soul
A long time ago... no, it was not a dream!
You barely walked in, I instantly recognized
Everything was stupefied, on fire
And in my thoughts I said: here he is!
Isn't it true? I heard you:
You spoke to me in silence
When I helped the poor
Or she delighted me with prayer
The longing of a worried soul?
And at this very moment
Isn't it you, sweet vision,
Flashed in the transparent darkness,
Quietly leaning against the headboard?
Isn't it you, with joy and love,
Did you whisper words of hope to me?
Who are you, my guardian angel,
Or the insidious tempter:
Resolve my doubts.
Maybe it's all empty
Deception of an inexperienced soul!
And something completely different is destined...
But so be it! my destiny
From now on I give you
I shed tears before you,
I beg your protection...
Imagine: I'm here alone,
Nobody understands me,
My mind is exhausted
And I must die in silence.
I'm waiting for you: with one glance
Revive the hopes of your heart
Or break the heavy dream,
Alas, a well-deserved reproach!
I'm cumming! It's scary to read...
I freeze with shame and fear...
But your honor is my guarantee,
And I boldly entrust myself to her...

To Chaadaev.
Love, hope, quiet glory
Deception did not last long for us,
The youthful fun has disappeared
Like a dream, like morning fog;
But the desire still burns within us,
Under the yoke of fatal power
With an impatient soul
Let us heed the calling of the Fatherland.
We wait with languid hope
Holy moments of freedom
How a young lover waits
Minutes of a faithful date.
While we are burning with freedom,
While hearts are alive for honor,
My friend, let's dedicate it to the fatherland
Beautiful impulses from the soul!
Comrade, believe: she will rise,
Star of captivating happiness,
Russia will wake up from its sleep,
And on the ruins of autocracy
They will write our names!

Winter morning.
Frost and sun; wonderful day!
You are still dozing, dear friend -
It's time, beauty, wake up:
Open your closed eyes
Towards northern Aurora,
Be the star of the north!
In the evening, do you remember, the blizzard was angry,
There was darkness in the cloudy sky;
The moon is like a pale spot
Through the dark clouds it turned yellow,
And you sat sad -
And now... look out the window:
Under blue skies
Magnificent carpets,
Glistening in the sun, the snow lies;
The transparent forest alone turns black,
And the spruce turns green through the frost,
And the river glitters under the ice.
The whole room has an amber shine
Illuminated. Cheerful crackling
The flooded stove crackles.
It's nice to think by the bed.
But you know: shouldn’t I tell you to get into the sleigh?
Ban the brown filly?
Sliding on the morning snow,
Dear friend, let's indulge in running
impatient horse
And we'll visit the empty fields,
The forests, recently so dense,
And the shore, dear to me.
