I am writing to you - what more?
What more can I say?
Now I know it's in your will
Punish me with contempt.
But you, to my unfortunate fate
Keeping at least a drop of pity,
You won't leave me.
At first I wanted to remain silent;
Believe me: my shame
You would never know
If only I had hope
At least rarely, at least once a week
To see you in our village,
Just to hear your speeches,
Say your word, and then
Think about everything, think about one thing
And day and night until we meet again.
But, they say, you are unsociable;
In the wilderness, in the village, everything is boring for you,
And we... we donâ€™t shine with anything,
Even though you are welcome in a simple-minded way.
Why did you visit us?
In the wilderness of a forgotten village
I would never have known you
I wouldn't know bitter torment.
Souls of inexperienced excitement
Having come to terms with time (who knows?),
I would find a friend after my heart,
If only I had a faithful wife
And a virtuous mother.
Another!.. No, no one in the world
I wouldn't give my heart!
It is destined in the highest council...
That is the will of heaven: I am yours;
My whole life was a pledge
The faithful's meeting with you;
I know you were sent to me by God,
Until the grave you are my keeper...
You appeared in my dreams,
Invisible, you were already dear to me,
Your wonderful gaze tormented me,
Your voice was heard in my soul
A long time ago... no, it was not a dream!
You barely walked in, I instantly recognized
Everything was stupefied, on fire
And in my thoughts I said: here he is!
Isn't it true? I heard you:
You spoke to me in silence
When I helped the poor
Or she delighted me with prayer
The longing of a worried soul?
And at this very moment
Isn't it you, sweet vision,
Flashed in the transparent darkness,
Quietly leaning against the headboard?
Isn't it you, with joy and love,
Did you whisper words of hope to me?
Who are you, my guardian angel,
Or the insidious tempter:
Resolve my doubts.
Maybe it's all empty
Deception of an inexperienced soul!
And something completely different is destined...
But so be it! my destiny
From now on I give you
I shed tears before you,
I beg your protection...
Imagine: I'm here alone,
Nobody understands me,
My mind is exhausted
And I must die in silence.
I'm waiting for you: with one glance
Revive the hopes of your heart
Or break the heavy dream,
Alas, a well-deserved reproach!
I'm cumming! It's scary to read...
I freeze with shame and fear...
But your honor is my guarantee,
And I boldly entrust myself to her...
